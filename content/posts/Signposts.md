### This is less a blog post and more a list of things I've spent a lot of time meditating -and eventually ended up- implementing for reasons (that unfortunately don't all fall under the banner of good software design and more under the banner of satisfying fleeting biases)

- The user must chat
- The user must accept chat
- The user must reject chat
- users should be lookable without matching
- The user must disable being lookable without matching
- The user must chat without matching
- The user must disable being approached for chatting without matching
- The user must have privacy
- The user must disable having privacy
- The user must block other users from matching
- The user must scroll on desktop
- The user must swipe on mobile
- The user should be notified by email
- The user should disable being notified by email
- The user should be notified while on-site
- The user should be notified with different logic for every area
- The user must delete his signpost
- The user must delete himself

- ...and probably 50 more

### Honorable Mentions

- The user must choose geography (Not implemented)
